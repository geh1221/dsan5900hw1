Admitted students had an average of 2.1 years of work experience and an average volunteer level of 2.2, similar to students who were waitlisted or declined.\n\nExploring Student Statistics Based on Admit Decision\nFor test score, writing score, and GPA there is a visible trend of admitted students having the highest average and declined students having the lowest average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor work experience and volunteer level there is no visible trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProportions of Admissions Based on Each Variable\n\nDemographics\nMale and female students had identical admit, waitlist, and decline rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are differences in admit, waitlist, and decline rates between states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScores\nThe students with the highest GPAs had the highest rates of admission to the internship. All students with GPAs of 3.9 or greater were admitted while the majority of students with GPAs of 3.6 or higher were admitted. No students with GPAs below 3.5 were admitted.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll students that scored above 900 on the test were admitted and all students that were waitlisted scored between 800 and 900.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll students with a writing score greater than 90 were admitted while the majority of students with a writing score below 90 were waitlisted or declined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperience\nThere is no visible trend when it comes to admit rates and work experience or volunteer level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Between Variables\nThe most strongly correlated variables are test score, GPA, and writing score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship Between Test Score and Other Variables\n\nDemographics\nAverage test score does not differ for male and female students.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three states with the highest test score averages (California, Florida, and Colorado) also had the highest admit rates for students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScores\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is one student with a low test score and high GPA who was admitted. All other admitted students were in the highest band of test scores (above 950).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis student also has a high writing score and is the only student with a low test score and high writing score to be admitted.\n\n\nExperience\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents with a wide range of work experiences were admitted, waitlisted, and declined. There does not appear to be a relationship between work experience and test score.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents with a wide range of volunteer levels were admitted, waitlisted, and declined. There does not appear to be a relationship between volunteer level and test score.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nBased on the trends explored above, the most important consideration for this company’s hiring team seemed to be the students’ test scores. With few exceptions, using only the test score for a student we can make a strong prediction for whether or not they were admitted."

The purpose of the report is to increase decision transparency and increase internship support and resources for students. We will do this through the following three goals:\n1. Identify trends within decision groups.\nThis will help us understand what was making a candidate successful.\n2. Identify the most important aspect of a student’s application\nThis will help us understand what students should focus on.\n3. Identify how the university can better support students\nThis will allow us to give tangible recommendations to universities to help students better prepare for internships."

Why may that be? Let’s explore this trend further below."

I think many would be surprised that candidate 1 got declined. As we have seen, a 3.84 is well within the range for acceptance. Their test scores and writing scores were also on the higher end of the waitlist range. Though lower than the accepted candidate 2, the scores are by no means poor and are well within the waitlist range at least. The question remains, why did this person get declined and not admitted, let alone waitlisted? The main difference we see between this candidate and the admitted and waitlisted candidates is the volunteer score. While volunteer score may be not significant for overall difference in groups, on an individual basis, this internship may be looking for students who put more effort into serving their community and volunteering. This theory would explain their declined status."

    "text": "The dataset contains information about 79 students applying to an internship. There are eight variables in the dataset related to a student’s background, various test scores, and the internship hiring decision. These six variables are the state the student is from, gender, GPA, test score, writing test score, the number of years of work experience they have,the level of effort they put into volunteering, and their admission decision (admitted, waitlisted, or declined). We will first investigate trends by admission decision in these variables as well as how correlated they are with the admission decision. These trends will help inform the board of the most important factors that internship hiring committes are using."
