title: "Our Goals and Purpose"
---

In this report we will explore trends in acceptance to a summer internship based on student demographics, scores, and experience. The purpose of the report is to increase decision transparency and increase internship support and resources for students. We will do this through the following three goals:

**1. Identify trends within decision groups.**

This will help us understand what was making a candidate successful. 

**2. Identify the most important aspect of a student's application**

This will help us understand what students should focus on. 

**3. Identify how the university can better support students**

This will allow us to give tangible recommendations to universities to help students better prepare for internships.
