With few exceptions, using only the test score for a student we can make a strong prediction for whether or not they were admitted."

I think many would be surprised that candidate 1 got declined. As we have seen, a 3.84 is well within the range for acceptance. Their test scores and writing scores were also on the higher end of the waitlist range. Though lower than the accepted candidate 2, the scores are by no means poor and are well within the waitlist range at least. The question remains, why did this person get declined and not admitted, let alone waitlisted? The main difference we see between this candidate and the admitted and waitlisted candidates is the volunteer score. While volunteer score may be not significant for overall difference in groups, on an individual basis, this internship may be looking for students who put more effort into serving their community and volunteering. This theory would explain their declined status."

    "text": "The dataset contains information about 79 students applying to an internship. There are eight variables in the dataset related to a student’s background, various test scores, and the internship hiring decision. These six variables are the state the student is from, gender, GPA, test score, writing test score, the number of years of work experience they have,the level of effort they put into volunteering, and their admission decision (admitted, waitlisted, or declined). We will first investigate trends by admission decision in these variables as well as how correlated they are with the admission decision. These trends will help inform the board of the most important factors that internship hiring committes are using."
